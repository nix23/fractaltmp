-> Deprecated (D2_Portals are used instead)

-> Use redux by default (
    It is hard to communicate between components without
    Still requires DataLists which should get state from redux
        (very hard without)
    React is used with Redux in most-cases
  )

<FormSearch Input={InputOrCustomInput}>
</FormSearch>

FormSearch can be added anywhere in any component in ReactRoot components
tree. It will render an input.

Now we should create and render Search dom elements.
Options:
1) Create 'Portal' and render Search into BODY
2) Raise redux action openSearch with input coords.
    --> Redux <App> > <ModalViews> will mount searchComponent with params
    --> All FormSearch logic will be contained inside that component
3) SearchComponent should be rendered over top of all other modal components
    (SearchComponent can be placed inside forms which are contained inside
     child modal Forms)

Cons(Redux)
    --> Integrates well with other modals inside 'Fractal'
    --> Don't hacks react render logic
Pros(Redux)
    --> Can't be used as separate React Component(Requires redux!!!)
    Or write Portal connector && Redux connector????

Redux:
  -> add ability to render Array of modal components:
  -> each have it's Component and priority
  -> render components according to priority
  -> all FormSearch components should be rendered over modals

1. We have Search component.
2. We have Search input component.

1 Redux
   Call showModal action with priority = X which will mount Search component
   <FormSearch Input={InputOrCustomInput}>
   </Form>
2 Portal
   Mount Search component through portal! 
   <FormSearch Input={InputOrCustomInput}>
        inside FormSearch
        connect FormSearchBody manually into BODY through Portal!!!!
   </Form>
