FormSearch should not know anything about Breakpoints.
FormSearch stores state with 'isMobile' alike prop.
IsMobile - can be later refactored into separate Component
    -> It can be not nec.-ry 'Breakpoints'
        -> ScreenSizeDetectorByBreakpoints
        -> ScreenSizeDetectorByNthParam...
            -> Remember that in your case it can be enough for
               Fractal to cover only 1 simple case 
               -> in such case first version of script can be enough
